## States of Files in The Git Life Cycle
There are two possible states a file in your working directory can be, tracked or untracked. A tracked file means it was included in the latest commit within Git. A tracked file can be either unmodifed, modified, or staged.

As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because youâ€™ve changed them since your last commit. As you work, you selectively stage these modified files and then commit all those staged changes, and the cycle repeats.

__The four stages of a file are:__

- __Untracked__

A file is in your working directory but not within your last commit.

- __Unmodified__

A tracked file that was within your last commit and hasn't been changed.

- __Modified__

A tracked file that was within your last commit and has been modified but not staged yet, and thus isn't able to be commited.

- __Staged__

An untracked or modified file that has been staged is ready to be commited to the repo.

## Relevant Commands
__Show Status:__ To check the status of the working directory for changes or additions, use:

```console
git status
```
__Stage Files:__ To stage a specific file, use: 
```console
git add <file-name>
```
To stage all unstaged files within your working directory, use:
```console
git add .
```
__Commiting Changes:__ To commit staged files to the repo, use:
```console
git commit -m "Commit Message"
```

__Show Differences__: To show the differences between your current working directory and the last commit made, use:
```console
git diff
```
